Only when training with a robust model that is not easily distracted by the noise, a good generalization performance can be achieved. A simple yet effective way to create a noise robust model is to use a noise robust loss function. However, the number of proposed loss functions is large, they often come with hyperparameters, and may learn slower than the widely used but noise sensitive Cross Entropy loss. By heuristic considerations and extensive numerical experiments, we study in which situations the proposed loss functions are applicable and give suggestions on how to choose an appropriate loss. Additionally, we propose a novel technique to enhance learning with bounded loss functions: the inclusion of an output bias, i.e. a slight increase in the neuron pre-activation corresponding to the correct label. Surprisingly, we find that this not only significantly improves the learning of bounded losses, but also leads to the Mean Absolute Error loss outperforming the Cross Entropy loss on the Cifar-100 dataset - even in the absence of additional label noise. This suggests that training with a bounded loss function can be advantageous even in the presence of minimal label noise. To further strengthen our analysis of the learning behavior of different loss functions, we additionally design and test a novel loss function denoted as Bounded Cross Entropy.\nComments:13 pages, 4 figures\nSubjects:Machine Learning (cs.LG); Disordered Systems and Neural Networks (cond-mat.dis-nn); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)\nCite as:arXiv:2306.05497 [cs.LG]\n(or arXiv:2306.05497v1 [cs.LG] for this version)\n\nFocus to learn more\narXiv-issued DOI via DataCite\nSubmission history\nFrom: Max Staats [view email] \n[v1] Thu, 8 Jun 2023 18:38:55 UTC (465 KB)\n( Mon, 24 Jun 2024 09:02:08 UTC (1,067 KB)\n( Mon, 27 Jan 2025 10:05:55 UTC (557 KB)\nFull-text links:\nAccess Paper:\nView a PDF of the paper titled Reevaluating Loss Functions: Enhancing Robustness to Label Noise in Deep Learning Models, by Max Staats and 2 other authors\n   View PDF\n   TeX Source\nview license\nCurrent browse context: \ncs.LG\n<prev\") | next>\")\nnew | recent | 2023-06\nChange to browse by: \ncond-mat\ncond-mat.dis-nn\ncs\ncs.AI\nReferences & Citations\n   NASA ADS\n   Google Scholar\n   Semantic Scholar\nexport BibTeX citation Loading...\nBibTeX formatted citation\n\u00d7\nData provided by: \nBookmark\nImage 5: BibSonomy logoImage 6: Reddit logo\nBibliographic Tools \nBibliographic and Citation Tools\n[x] Bibliographic Explorer Toggle \nBibliographic Explorer _(What is the Explorer?)_\n[x] Connected Papers Toggle \nConnected Papers _(What is Connected Papers?)_\n[x] Litmaps Toggle \nLitmaps _(What is Litmaps?)_\n[x] scite.ai Toggle \nscite Smart Citations _(What are Smart Citations?)_\nCode, Data, Media \nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n[x] alphaXiv Toggle \nalphaXiv _(What is alphaXiv?)_\n[x] Links to Code Toggle \nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers _(What is CatalyzeX?)_\n[x] DagsHub Toggle \nDagsHub _(What is DagsHub?)_\n[x] GotitPub Toggle \nGotit.pub _(What is GotitPub?)_\n[x] Huggingface Toggle \nHugging Face _(What is Huggingface?)_\n[x] Links to Code Toggle \nPapers with Code _(What is Papers with Code?)_\n[x] ScienceCast Toggle \nScienceCast _(What is ScienceCast?)_\nDemos \nDemos\n[x] Replicate Toggle \nReplicate _(What is Replicate?)_\n[x] Spaces Toggle \nHugging Face Spaces _(What is Spaces?)_\n[x] Spaces Toggle \nTXYZ.AI _(What is TXYZ.AI?)_\nRelated Papers \nRecommenders and Search Tools\n[x] Link to Influence Flower \nInfluence Flower _(What are Influence Flowers?)_\n[x] Core recommender toggle \nCORE Recommender _(What is CORE?)_\n[x] IArxiv recommender toggle \nIArxiv Recommender _(What is IArxiv?)_\n   Author\n   Venue\n   Institution\n   Topic\nAbout arXivLabs  \narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
