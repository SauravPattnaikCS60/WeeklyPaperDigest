In recent years, a numerous number of uncertainty quantification methods have been introduced. Monte Carlo dropout (MC-Dropout) is one of the most well-known techniques to quantify uncertainty in deep learning methods. In this study, we propose two new loss functions by combining cross entropy with Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Predictive Entropy (PE). The obtained results clearly show that the new proposed loss functions lead to having a calibrated MC-Dropout method. Our results confirmed the great impact of the new hybrid loss functions for minimising the overlap between the distributions of uncertainty estimates for correct and incorrect predictions without sacrificing the model's overall performance.\nComments:11 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables\nSubjects:Machine Learning (cs.LG); Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)\nCite as:arXiv:2110.03260 [cs.LG]\n(or arXiv:2110.03260v2 [cs.LG] for this version)\n\nFocus to learn more\narXiv-issued DOI via DataCite\nSubmission history\nFrom: Abbas Khosravi [view email] \n( Thu, 7 Oct 2021 08:31:23 UTC (904 KB)\n[v2] Mon, 6 Feb 2023 00:10:14 UTC (1,841 KB)\nFull-text links:\nAccess Paper:\nView a PDF of the paper titled An Uncertainty-aware Loss Function for Training Neural Networks with Calibrated Predictions, by Afshar Shamsi and 4 other authors\n   View PDF\n   TeX Source\nview license\nCurrent browse context: \ncs.LG\n<prev\") | next>\")\nnew | recent | 2021-10\nChange to browse by: \ncs\ncs.CV\nReferences & Citations\n   NASA ADS\n   Google Scholar\n   Semantic Scholar\nDBLP - CS Bibliography\nlisting | bibtex\nAbbas Khosravi\nSaeid Nahavandi\nexport BibTeX citation Loading...\nBibTeX formatted citation\n\u00d7\nData provided by: \nBookmark\nImage 5: BibSonomy logoImage 6: Reddit logo\nBibliographic Tools \nBibliographic and Citation Tools\n[x] Bibliographic Explorer Toggle \nBibliographic Explorer _(What is the Explorer?)_\n[x] Connected Papers Toggle \nConnected Papers _(What is Connected Papers?)_\n[x] Litmaps Toggle \nLitmaps _(What is Litmaps?)_\n[x] scite.ai Toggle \nscite Smart Citations _(What are Smart Citations?)_\nCode, Data, Media \nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n[x] alphaXiv Toggle \nalphaXiv _(What is alphaXiv?)_\n[x] Links to Code Toggle \nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers _(What is CatalyzeX?)_\n[x] DagsHub Toggle \nDagsHub _(What is DagsHub?)_\n[x] GotitPub Toggle \nGotit.pub _(What is GotitPub?)_\n[x] Huggingface Toggle \nHugging Face _(What is Huggingface?)_\n[x] Links to Code Toggle \nPapers with Code _(What is Papers with Code?)_\n[x] ScienceCast Toggle \nScienceCast _(What is ScienceCast?)_\nDemos \nDemos\n[x] Replicate Toggle \nReplicate _(What is Replicate?)_\n[x] Spaces Toggle \nHugging Face Spaces _(What is Spaces?)_\n[x] Spaces Toggle \nTXYZ.AI _(What is TXYZ.AI?)_\nRelated Papers \nRecommenders and Search Tools\n[x] Link to Influence Flower \nInfluence Flower _(What are Influence Flowers?)_\n[x] Core recommender toggle \nCORE Recommender _(What is CORE?)_\n[x] IArxiv recommender toggle \nIArxiv Recommender _(What is IArxiv?)_\n   Author\n   Venue\n   Institution\n   Topic\nAbout arXivLabs  \narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
