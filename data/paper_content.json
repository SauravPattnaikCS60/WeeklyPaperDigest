In contrast, modern artificially intelligent systems often require thousands or millions of observations in order to solve even the most basic tasks. Meta-learning aims to resolve this issue by leveraging past experiences from similar learning tasks to embed the appropriate inductive biases into the learning system. Historically methods for meta-learning components such as optimizers, parameter initializations, and more have led to significant performance increases. This thesis aims to explore the concept of meta-learning to improve performance, through the often-overlooked component of the loss function. The loss function is a vital component of a learning system, as it represents the primary learning objective, where success is determined and quantified by the system's ability to optimize for that objective successfully.\nComments:PhD thesis\nSubjects:Machine Learning (cs.LG); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE)\nCite as:arXiv:2406.09713 [cs.LG]\n(or arXiv:2406.09713v3 [cs.LG] for this version)\n\nFocus to learn more\narXiv-issued DOI via DataCite\nSubmission history\nFrom: Christian Raymond [view email] \n( Fri, 14 Jun 2024 04:46:14 UTC (13,524 KB)\n( Sat, 29 Jun 2024 23:51:03 UTC (13,520 KB)\n[v3] Wed, 7 May 2025 01:38:16 UTC (24,421 KB)\nFull-text links:\nAccess Paper:\nView a PDF of the paper titled Meta-Learning Loss Functions for Deep Neural Networks, by Christian Raymond\n   View PDF\n   TeX Source\nImage 5: license iconview license\nCurrent browse context: \ncs.LG\n<prev\") | next>\")\nnew | recent | 2024-06\nChange to browse by: \ncs\ncs.AI\ncs.NE\nReferences & Citations\n   NASA ADS\n   Google Scholar\n   Semantic Scholar\nexport BibTeX citation Loading...\nBibTeX formatted citation\n\u00d7\nData provided by: \nBookmark\nImage 6: BibSonomy logoImage 7: Reddit logo\nBibliographic Tools \nBibliographic and Citation Tools\n[x] Bibliographic Explorer Toggle \nBibliographic Explorer _(What is the Explorer?)_\n[x] Connected Papers Toggle \nConnected Papers _(What is Connected Papers?)_\n[x] Litmaps Toggle \nLitmaps _(What is Litmaps?)_\n[x] scite.ai Toggle \nscite Smart Citations _(What are Smart Citations?)_\nCode, Data, Media \nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n[x] alphaXiv Toggle \nalphaXiv _(What is alphaXiv?)_\n[x] Links to Code Toggle \nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers _(What is CatalyzeX?)_\n[x] DagsHub Toggle \nDagsHub _(What is DagsHub?)_\n[x] GotitPub Toggle \nGotit.pub _(What is GotitPub?)_\n[x] Huggingface Toggle \nHugging Face _(What is Huggingface?)_\n[x] Links to Code Toggle \nPapers with Code _(What is Papers with Code?)_\n[x] ScienceCast Toggle \nScienceCast _(What is ScienceCast?)_\nDemos \nDemos\n[x] Replicate Toggle \nReplicate _(What is Replicate?)_\n[x] Spaces Toggle \nHugging Face Spaces _(What is Spaces?)_\n[x] Spaces Toggle \nTXYZ.AI _(What is TXYZ.AI?)_\nRelated Papers \nRecommenders and Search Tools\n[x] Link to Influence Flower \nInfluence Flower _(What are Influence Flowers?)_\n[x] Core recommender toggle \nCORE Recommender _(What is CORE?)_\n[x] IArxiv recommender toggle \nIArxiv Recommender _(What is IArxiv?)_\n   Author\n   Venue\n   Institution\n   Topic\nAbout arXivLabs  \narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
