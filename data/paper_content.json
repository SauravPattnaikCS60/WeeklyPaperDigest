Recent instruction tuning (IT) involves fine-tuning models to make them more adaptable to solving NLP tasks in general. However, it is still uncertain how instruction tuning works in the context of CL tasks. This challenging yet practical problem is formulated as Continual Instruction Tuning (CIT). In this work, we establish a CIT benchmark consisting of learning and evaluation protocols. We curate two long dialogue task streams of different types, InstrDialog and InstrDialog++, to study various CL methods systematically. Our experiments show that existing CL methods do not effectively leverage the rich natural language instructions, and fine-tuning an instruction-tuned model sequentially can yield similar or better results. We further explore different aspects that might affect the learning of CIT. We hope this benchmark will facilitate more research in this direction.\nComments:EMNLP 2023 Findings\nSubjects:Computation and Language (cs.CL)\nCite as:arXiv:2310.14510 [cs.CL]\n(or arXiv:2310.14510v1 [cs.CL] for this version)\n\nFocus to learn more\narXiv-issued DOI via DataCite\nSubmission history\nFrom: Zihan Zhang [view email] \n[v1] Mon, 23 Oct 2023 02:42:32 UTC (260 KB)\nFull-text links:\nAccess Paper:\nView a PDF of the paper titled CITB: A Benchmark for Continual Instruction Tuning, by Zihan Zhang and 3 other authors\n   View PDF\n   TeX Source\nImage 5: license iconview license\nCurrent browse context: \ncs.CL\n<prev\") | next>\")\nnew | recent | 2023-10\nChange to browse by: \ncs\nReferences & Citations\n   NASA ADS\n   Google Scholar\n   Semantic Scholar\nexport BibTeX citation Loading...\nBibTeX formatted citation\n\u00d7\nData provided by: \nBookmark\nImage 6: BibSonomy logoImage 7: Reddit logo\nBibliographic Tools \nBibliographic and Citation Tools\n[x] Bibliographic Explorer Toggle \nBibliographic Explorer _(What is the Explorer?)_\n[x] Connected Papers Toggle \nConnected Papers _(What is Connected Papers?)_\n[x] Litmaps Toggle \nLitmaps _(What is Litmaps?)_\n[x] scite.ai Toggle \nscite Smart Citations _(What are Smart Citations?)_\nCode, Data, Media \nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n[x] alphaXiv Toggle \nalphaXiv _(What is alphaXiv?)_\n[x] Links to Code Toggle \nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers _(What is CatalyzeX?)_\n[x] DagsHub Toggle \nDagsHub _(What is DagsHub?)_\n[x] GotitPub Toggle \nGotit.pub _(What is GotitPub?)_\n[x] Huggingface Toggle \nHugging Face _(What is Huggingface?)_\n[x] Links to Code Toggle \nPapers with Code _(What is Papers with Code?)_\n[x] ScienceCast Toggle \nScienceCast _(What is ScienceCast?)_\nDemos \nDemos\n[x] Replicate Toggle \nReplicate _(What is Replicate?)_\n[x] Spaces Toggle \nHugging Face Spaces _(What is Spaces?)_\n[x] Spaces Toggle \nTXYZ.AI _(What is TXYZ.AI?)_\nRelated Papers \nRecommenders and Search Tools\n[x] Link to Influence Flower \nInfluence Flower _(What are Influence Flowers?)_\n[x] Core recommender toggle \nCORE Recommender _(What is CORE?)_\n   Author\n   Venue\n   Institution\n   Topic\nAbout arXivLabs  \narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
