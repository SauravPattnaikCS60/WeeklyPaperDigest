ViT divides an image into 16\u00d716 patches, embeds them, and processes the resulting sequence with a standard Transformer encoder. When pre\u2011trained on large datasets and fine\u2011tuned on smaller benchmarks such as ImageNet, CIFAR\u2011100, and VTAB, ViT matches or surpasses state\u2011of\u2011the\u2011art CNNs while requiring fewer computational resources. The authors show that the Transformer\u2019s self\u2011attention mechanism alone is sufficient to learn rich visual representations. The study also discusses the impact of different classification heads (CLS token vs Global Average Pooling). Overall, the work presents a compelling case for pure Transformers in computer vision, simplifying model design and improving scalability.", "relevance": "ViT marks a shift away from the long\u2011standing dominance of convolutional architectures in vision, opening avenues for large\u2011scale pre\u2011training on diverse image datasets.
