[{"paper_title": "Meta-Learning Loss Functions for Deep Neural Networks", "paper_summary": "This PhD thesis investigates how meta\u2011learning can be applied to the design of loss functions for deep neural networks, a component that has historically received less attention than optimizers or parameter initializations. The work is motivated by the observation that humans can learn new tasks from a few examples, whereas current AI systems require large datasets. By treating the loss function as a learnable object that can be adapted across related tasks, the author aims to embed task\u2011specific inductive biases directly into the objective. The thesis reviews existing meta\u2011learning methods, introduces a framework for learning loss functions, and evaluates it on standard benchmarks. Experiments show that meta\u2011learned losses can reduce training data requirements and improve generalization compared to hand\u2011crafted losses. The study highlights the importance of the loss in steering learning dynamics and proposes that learning it can lead to more efficient and robust models.", "relevance": "The paper expands the scope of meta\u2011learning beyond optimizers and initializations to the very core of training: the loss function. By demonstrating that loss functions can be learned from past tasks, it offers a new pathway to improve data efficiency and transfer learning in deep networks. This work may inspire future research into task\u2011specific objective design, automated curriculum learning, and improved few\u2011shot learning systems. It also suggests practical benefits for applications where labeled data is scarce or expensive.", "related_topics": ["Meta\u2011learning of learning objectives", "Few\u2011shot and data\u2011efficient deep learning", "Automated loss function design"], "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09713"}]
