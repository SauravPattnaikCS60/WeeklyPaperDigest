[{"paper_title": "An Uncertainty-aware Loss Function for Training Neural Networks with Calibrated Predictions", "paper_summary": "The authors propose two hybrid loss functions that merge standard cross\u2011entropy with either Expected Calibration Error (ECE) or Predictive Entropy (PE). These losses are applied during training of neural networks that use Monte\u2011Carlo dropout to estimate predictive uncertainty. Experimental results show that the new loss functions produce models whose uncertainty estimates are well\u2011calibrated, as indicated by lower ECE values and reduced overlap between the distributions of uncertainty for correct versus incorrect predictions. Importantly, the improvements in calibration are achieved without hurting overall classification accuracy. The paper demonstrates that explicitly guiding the training objective toward calibration can be a simple and effective alternative to post\u2011hoc temperature scaling or other calibration techniques. It offers a practical way to build models that not only predict labels but also provide trustworthy confidence estimates, which is crucial for safety\u2011critical applications such as medical imaging or autonomous driving.", "relevance": "Calibrated uncertainty predictions are essential for deploying deep learning models in real\u2011world scenarios where decisions must account for risk. By integrating calibration metrics directly into the loss, this work paves the way for more reliable and interpretable AI systems. Future research may extend these hybrid losses to other forms of Bayesian approximations, explore their effects on diverse architectures, or combine them with active learning strategies that rely on accurate uncertainty estimates.", "related_topics": ["Uncertainty Quantification in Neural Networks", "Calibration of Machine Learning Models", "Monte Carlo Dropout"], "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.03260"}]
